I’m an AI engineer and back-end technical lead with around 10 years of experience building production software. My work sits at the intersection of AI systems and classical backend engineering for high-load systems.

I focus on AI systems that have to survive contact with reality: business needs, cost, reliability, and operational constraints.

I’m not interested in hype cycles or “AI will replace everything” narratives. Most posts are practical and based on things that worked, failed, or turned out to be trickier than expected. From time to time, I may also write about non-technical but related topics, such as management, business, markets, etc.

Background: MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Leeds, long-term backend experience.
